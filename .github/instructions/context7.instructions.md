## Context7

- **Always use the context7 MCP server** to reference documentation for libraries like Tailwindcss v4 and React 18.
- For the tokens, **start with 5000** but then **increase to 20000** if your first search didn’t give relevant documentation.
- **Only search three times maximum for any specific piece of documentation.** If you don’t get what you need, use the Brave MCP server to perform a wider search.
